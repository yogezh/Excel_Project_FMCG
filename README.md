# AtliQ Mart - Supply Chain FMCG Domain Insights - In Excel

## ðŸŒŸ Project Challenge: Enhancing Supply Chain Performance through Data Analytics ðŸŒŸ

This project was completed as part of the **Codebasics challenge**, focusing on enhancing supply chain performance for an FMCG company through data analytics. The goal was to address key delivery service issues faced by AtliQ Mart, an FMCG company planning to expand to new cities.

## ðŸ“Œ The Challenge

AtliQ Mart faced issues with delays and incomplete deliveries, which affected key customer contracts. The main challenge was to measure and track the following service metrics:

- **On-time delivery (OT) %**
- **In-full delivery (IF) %**
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF) %**

The objective was to track these metrics on a daily basis, allowing the supply chain team to identify issues quickly and improve service levels.

## ðŸ“Š My Role & Excel Expertise

As a **Data Analyst**, I used **Excel** to build a detailed report that tracked these essential metrics. I applied several advanced Excel features to achieve the following:

- **Measure OTIF %** for each customer against target benchmarks.
- Break down performance by **cities**, **months**, and **products**.
- Calculate additional key metrics like **Volume Fill Rate (VoFR)** and **Line Fill Rate (LiFR)**.
- Provide **actionable insights** that identify areas for improvement and propose solutions.

### Tools & Techniques Used:

- **Power Query**: To import, clean, and transform data.
- **Power Pivot**: For advanced data modeling and establishing relationships between different data sets.
- **Pivot Tables**: To summarize, analyze, and visualize key metrics.
  
### Structure

The report consists of several tables and analyses:

- **OTIF % Calculation**: Performance evaluation based on customer delivery metrics.
- **City/Month/Product-Based Breakdown**: Insights on performance segmented by city, month, and product.
- **Volume Fill Rate (VoFR) & Line Fill Rate (LiFR)**: Additional performance metrics based on product fulfillment.
